    "## Iterator pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators enables you to represent sequences with or without using a data structure. All you have to know is its two interface: `#has_next()` and `#next()`. You cannot get elements which have already traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- has_next() -> Boolean (Returns whether you have next element to traverse)\n",
    "- next() -> Item (Returns the next element)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can create iterator `with` or `without` an underlying object.\n",
    "    - with: Linked List, an Array, a Tree, a State Machine, a file reader\n",
    "    - without: number generator(e.g. range of sequence(min=10, max=50))\n",
    "- You can make iteration on `infinite` or `infinite` sequence.\n",
    "    - finite: LinkedList, infinite range(e.g. min=10)\n",
    "    - infinite: Array, finite range (e.g. min=10, max=50)\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is space efficient.\n",
    "    - It takes only O(1) space since it does not copy the whole data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You don't have to know `how the underlying data structure works` as well as `the spefic way to traverse it`.\n",
    "    - (e.g. Implementing traversal of LinkedList is confusing)\n",
