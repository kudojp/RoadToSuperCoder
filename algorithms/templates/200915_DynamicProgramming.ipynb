    "A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N − 1. There is a number written on each square. A non-empty array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N − 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. Finally, we mark square number I + K.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N − 1), we calculate the result. The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the following array:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A[0] = 1\n",

    "    A[2] = 0\n",
    "    A[3] = 9\n",
    "    A[4] = -1\n",
    "    A[5] = -2\n",
    "one possible game could be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "the pebble is on square number 0, which is marked;\n",
    "we throw 3; the pebble moves from square number 0 to square number 3; we mark square number 3;\n",
    "we throw 5; the pebble does not move, since there is no square number 8 on the board;\n",
    "we throw 2; the pebble moves to square number 5; we mark this square and the game ends.\n",
    "The marked squares are 0, 3 and 5, so the result of the game is 1 + 9 + (−2) = 8. This is the maximal possible result that can be achieved on this board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def solution(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximal result that can be achieved on the board represented by array A.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the array\n",
    "\n",
    "    A[0] = 1\n",

    "    A[3] = 9\n",
    "    A[4] = -1\n",
    "    A[5] = -2\n",
    "the function should return 8, as explained above.\n",

    "Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:\n",
